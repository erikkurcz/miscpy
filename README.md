## Miscellaneous Python code

This repo to hold various code projects.

* **Die.py** - a python class to mimic the same implementation in python as appears in the [**java section**][1] of this Github account. Incidentally, I have coded in python for 2 years (as of May 2018) but Java for just a week or two, so this particular file was created to see how easy (or frustrating!) it would be to write the same code in python vs. Java. Turns out using a strongly typed, compiled language provides a number of benefits and forces the programmer to really think about how they're programming...
